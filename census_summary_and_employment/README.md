## Purpose

This project uses census data to investigate the best place to live in Ontario, broken down by economic region and city.

This data is all from the year 2021.

## Of Note

This part of the project involves cleaning the census data for analysis. The files are too large for normal git, so to run this code locally you have to download the datasets yourself. You can find the datasets at the below links.

* For census summaries broken down by econoomic region and census division and subdivision (download both the economic regions file and the file containing breakdown by both census division and census subdivision):
