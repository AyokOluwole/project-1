## Purpose

This project uses census data to investigate the best place to live in Ontario, broken down by economic region and city.

This data is all from the year 2021.

## Of Note

This part of the project involves cleaning the census data for analysis. Most of the data files are too large for normal git, so to run this code locally you have to download the datasets yourself. You can find the datasets at the below links.

* For census summaries broken down by census division and subdivision:

* For wage data by economic region and job (download the 2021 data):
    * https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/adad580f-76b0-4502-bd05-20c125de9116
* For employment numbers per economic region (download the full dataset):
    * https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=1410038901

The exception to this is a csv with the breakdown of Census Divisions in each Economic Region, which can be found in the Resources folder
